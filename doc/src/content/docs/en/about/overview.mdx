So far, we have introduced various articles on the blog, mainly as tips. From now on, we aim to compile information as more systematic and practical manuals. We considered expanding the blog system, but after exploring easier ways to create and maintain content, we decided to publish it as a separate documentation site. This site provides detailed manuals and guides on various products and technologies to help users utilize the information more efficiently.

### Sitecore CDP + Personalize

Sitecore CDP (Customer Data Platform) and Personalize are tools that support the integration of customer data and the provision of personalized experiences. CDP is a platform for integrating and analyzing customer data collected from various channels.
