## Added Content for Moosend / Sitecore Send

We have added content related to Moosend and Sitecore Send, the email marketing tools provided by Sitecore.

- [Overview of Moosend / Sitecore Send](/send/overview/)

Currently, there is only an article about the free trial of Moosend, but tips that have been introduced in the blog so far will be added sequentially.

## Changes in Content Provision for CDP + Personalize

The content for CDP + Personalize, which we initially started providing, has been changed to a more understandable format by separating the elements. There are no changes to the following page that introduces both.

- [About Sitecore CDP + Personalize](/cdp-personalize/overview/)

The structure for explaining the products is as follows:

- **Sitecore Personalize**: Content will be provided under the path _/personalize_
- **Sitecore CDP**: Content will be provided under the path _/cdp_

Accordingly, the URL for the previously provided Personalize content has been changed.
