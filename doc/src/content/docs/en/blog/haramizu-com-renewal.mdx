## Started the Renewal of Haramizu.com

Until now, Haramizu.com has been introducing articles in the form of Tips, which include questions received at work and articles that might be useful to introduce. However, the readability of the site has deteriorated due to the increasing number of articles.

Therefore, we are launching a new site to introduce the still relevant content of the traditional topics in a more detailed manner, making it possible to view them systematically.

As the first step, I believe that the blog articles related to the following products have become easier to refer to compared to before.

- [Sitecore Cloud Portal](/cloud-portal/overview/)
- [Sitecore CDP + Personalize](/cdp-personalize/overview/)

Also, this documentation site and blog are created using Astro. The actual steps to create it can be referred to on the following pages.

- [Using Starlight](/astro/starlight/)
- [Adding a Blog to Starlight](/astro/starlight-blog/)

## Future Plans

Basically, new Tips will be posted on this site.

However, the blogs that have been posted so far can still be referred to at the following URL.

- https://blog.haramizu.com/

Once a certain amount of content has been migrated to this site, the blog-only site will be closed, and the content will be viewable at the top-level domain.
