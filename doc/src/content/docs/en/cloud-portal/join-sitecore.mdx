This section introduces the steps to join the Sitecore Cloud Portal after receiving an invitation email from the administrator.

## Receiving the Invitation Email

The email you receive from the administrator will be sent to the email address you will use to log in. A sample of the actual email you receive is shown below.

You need to act on this email within 7 days of receiving it. The administrator can check the status of the invitation from the [Invitations](/cloud-portal/overview/#invitations) screen.

Click `Go To Portal` in the invitation email to proceed with logging into the portal. When you click it, the login screen will appear as shown below.

### First Time Use

If you are using the Sitecore Cloud Portal for the first time, click `Sign up` under Continue on the accessed screen to proceed with creating an account.

After entering the invited email address, you will be taken to a screen to set a new account password.

The password rules are as follows:

- At least 8 characters
- Contains at least three of the following:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Symbols (!@#$%^&\* etc.)

After setting a password that meets these rules, click `Continue`. If the account is created, information about the invited organization will be displayed.
