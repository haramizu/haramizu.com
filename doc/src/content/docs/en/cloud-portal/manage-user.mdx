This section introduces the types of user roles that can be managed in the Sitecore Cloud Portal and the permissions that can be assigned.

## About Roles

The Sitecore Cloud Portal provides three types of roles.

| Role  | Description                                                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User  | Use of assigned applications. Up to 25 applications.                                                    |
| Admin | Invite users to the organization<br /> Set up SSO and MFA<br />Use XM Cloud Deploy<br /> Access support |
| Owner | Has the same permissions as Admin<br /> Can add or remove Organization Owners                           |

The following screen shows the portal when a User is set to use one application.

The screen below shows the view when logged in as an Admin. All tools and portal management features are accessible. However, it is noted that inviting an Organization Owner is not possible.

When logged in as an Organization Owner, it is possible to add an Owner via Invitation.

As shown above, utilizing the three types of roles is important for smooth user addition and management during operations, as well as setting up administrators and determining Organization Owners.

## Summary

This section introduces the roles that need to be understood for user management and the permissions for applications that users can use.

There is always one Organization Owner, but it is recommended to assign multiple people to handle any issues that may arise.
