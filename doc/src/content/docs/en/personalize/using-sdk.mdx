This document provides detailed information on the SDKs that are useful when integrating Sitecore CDP + Personalize with your website. By using these SDKs, it becomes easier to collect customer data and provide personalized experiences.

## About the SDKs

We offer two types of SDKs for integrating with Sitecore Personalize: the Sitecore Cloud SDK and the Sitecore Engage SDK. Each is used in different scenarios.

### Sitecore Cloud SDK for JavaScript

First, let's discuss the Sitecore Cloud SDK. This SDK is straightforward and is designed for Sitecore XM Cloud created with Next.js. It has been available since Sitecore JSS 21.6.

If you refer to the package.json file of the recently provided Next.js Starter Kit, it is described as follows:

```json {3}
// package.json
  "dependencies": {
    "@sitecore-cloudsdk/events": "^0.3.1",
    "@sitecore-feaas/clientside": "^0.5.17",
    "@sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-nextjs": "~22.1.3",
    "@sitecore/components": "^1.1.10",
    "bootstrap": "^5.1.3",
```

As shown above, sitecore-cloudsdk/events is installed by default.

### Sitecore Engage SDK

This SDK is designed to simplify the configuration and operation of Sitecore CDP + Personalize. It is intended for web applications created with Next.js, React, and JavaScript. Therefore, it can be used on most websites without CMS restrictions.

This documentation site provides samples assuming the use of the Sitecore Engage SDK.

### Differences between the SDKs

The differences between each SDK are introduced on the following page:

Key points include:

- The Cloud SDK is provided as a license for use with XM Cloud, while the Engage SDK is released for CDP + Personalize users.
- The Engage SDK is intended for Next.js, React.js, and Vanilla JavaScript applications.
- Only the Engage SDK can be used with tools like Google Tag Manager.
- Only the Cloud SDK can capture form events.
- However, custom event capture is available with both.
- The Cloud SDK supports personalization for XM Cloud.
