In XM Cloud, if there is a possibility of sharing content between sites, you can create a Collection to manage multiple sites within it. You can create multiple Collections, but content cannot be shared across Collections, so if you want to manage them completely separately, you will have multiple Collections.

## Various Tools

The overview of various tools provided by Sitecore XM Cloud is as follows.

### XM Cloud Deploy

XM Cloud Deploy is a tool for launching the CMS provided by Sitecore XM Cloud, allowing access to various functions of the CMS. From XM Cloud Deploy, you can create XM Cloud projects using either a basic template or existing code, and manage projects, environments, and deployments.

In XM Cloud Deploy, you can manage the following:

- Project
  - Environment
- Credentials: Create and manage certificates for accessing the Organization and Environment APIs.
- Connections: Register services such as GitHub and Hosting.
- System Status: View the status of various services of Sitecore XM Cloud.

### Page Builder

Sitecore's CMS makes it easy to create, edit, and publish content through an intuitive interface. Page Builder allows you to easily manage web pages and digital assets using drag-and-drop functionality.

### Forms
